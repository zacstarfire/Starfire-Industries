== Covers

You can specify an image or a PDF page to use as either cover of the
document directly in your theme.

=== Front and back covers

The front cover image is assigned using the front-image key, and the
back cover image using the back-image key. Specifying the path as the
target of an inline image macro allows you to specify parameters for
that image, as shown here:

.Example
----
cover:
  front:
    image: image:cover.pdf[page=2]
  back:
    image: image:splash.png[fit=fill]
----

A cover image is handled like a background image, so the fit, width, and
position attributes can be specified.

=== Fit, width, and position

By default, background images are automatically scaled to fit the bounds of
the page (i.e., fit=contain) and centered (i.e., position=center). Wrapping
the value in the image macro allows you to customize an imageâ€™s size and
position. The size of the image assigned with an image macro can be
controlled using the sizing attributes, fit, pdfwidth, scaledwidth, or
width, when fit=none. The position of the image can be controlled using
the position attribute.

.Example
----
page:
  background-image: image:page-bg.png[fit=none,position=top center]
----
